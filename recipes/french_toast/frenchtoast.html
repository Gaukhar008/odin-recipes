    <p><strong>French</strong> toast is a dish made of sliced bread soaked in beaten eggs 
        and typically milk, then pan fried. Alternative names and variants include "eggy bread",
        "Bombay toast", "gypsy toast", and "poor knights" (of Windsor).</p>
    <p>When French toast is served as a sweet dish, milk, sugar, vanilla or cinnamon are also
         commonly added before pan-frying, and then it may be topped with sugar (often powdered 
         sugar), butter, fruit, or syrup. When it is a savory dish, it is generally fried with a 
         pinch of salt or pepper, and it can then be served with a sauce such as ketchup or 
         mayonnaise.</p>
